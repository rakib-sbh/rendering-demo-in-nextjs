## Server and Client Composition Patterns

- ### Server Components
  - Fetching data
  - Directly accessing backend resources
  - Protecting sensitive information (like access tokens and API keys) on the server
  - Keeping large dependencies server-side, which helps in reducing client-side JavaScript
- ### Client Components
  - Adding interactivity
  - Handling event listeners (such as `onClick()`, `onChange()`, etc)
  - Managing state and lifecycle effects (using hooks like `useState()`, `useReducer()`, `useEffect()`)
  - Using browser-exclusive APIs
  - Using custom hooks
  - Using React Class components
